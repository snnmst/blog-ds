Hello! In this blog, I will share my interests and learning journey in 
**data science**, **machine learning**, **artificial intelligence**, and **technical notes**.

🎯 I will especially focus on the following:

- 🔬 The technical knowledge I gained during my master's degree
- 📈 Self-tested projects, modeling approaches and analysis
- 🧠 Notes I took during the learning process, resources I found interesting
- 🛠️ Open source and experimental studies

This page is an archive for me, a learning diary.  
It can also be considered as a portfolio that grows over time.

See you in new posts!
