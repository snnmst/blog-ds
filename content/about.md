ğŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Sinan

I'm pursuing my Master's in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at Bogazici University Istanbul.
ğŸŒ±  I'm deeply engaged in the intersection of machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, computer vision, and LLM-based NLP. Iâ€™m particularly interested in RAG architectures, RLHF pipelines, and agent-based reasoning. My goal is to turn cutting-edge techniques into scalable, real-world solutions.

The projects and posts I share here reflect my personal learning journey and interests in AI.
